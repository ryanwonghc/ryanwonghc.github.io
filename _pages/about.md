**Introduction**

I am a junior majoring in Industrial and Operations Engineering and minoring in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am a proponent of data driven decision making and am passionate about using statistical and predictive analytics in order to extract meaning from data and improve the efficiency of complex processes. To solidify my interest in this field, I am pursuing a major in Industrial and Operations Engineering and a minor in Computer Science, and have involved myself in a variety of academic and extracurricular experiences.

I was born in Hong Kong and enjoy travelling to broaden my horizons and gain different perspectives by learning about different cultures and schools of thought. I am pursuing an international minor and plan on studying/working abroad sometime in the near future.
