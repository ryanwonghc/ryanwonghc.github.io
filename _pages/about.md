## Introduction

I am a sophomore majoring in Industrial and Operations Engineering and minoring in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am a proponent of data driven decision making and am passionate about using statistical and predictive analytics in order to extract meaning from data and improve the efficiency of complex processes. 

I was born in Hong Kong and enjoy travelling to broaden my horizons and gain different perspectives by learning about different cultures and schools of thought. I am pursuing an international minor and plan on studying/working abroad sometime in the near future.
