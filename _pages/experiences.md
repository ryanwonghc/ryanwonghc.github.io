### Adaptive Designs for Human Mobility Safety

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/UMTRI.jpg)

I was previously involved as a student researcher at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. My team and I aimed to evaluate the influence of variations in body geometry on body impact responses. My role was to capture and model the variability in the head region. I did so by processing patient anthropometric measurements and CT scans to create a dataset of medical data. Using this dataset, I created and refined a regression model that predicts an individual’s head shape and size given their medical data. These predictions were then used to create individualized finite element models of the subject’s body that were subjected to simulated impact testing to evaluate the subject’s injury risk in different vehicular accidents. Ultimately, this injury assessment data will be used to create vehicle safety designs to better protect vulnerable populations.

With no prior statistics experience, the most challenging technical aspect of the project was grasping the concept and purpose of principal component analysis (PCA) then putting the theory into practice. I was able to overcome this by taking full advantage of all the resources at my disposal. From reading articles to watching videos to asking professors and peers for help, I sought to accumulate as much information about PCA as I could. Equally important was my willingness to learn by doing. I began creating my regression model on MATLAB before I had fully grasped the concept of PCA, and the process of debugging my program greatly aided my understanding of PCA. Using the debugger, I was able to visualize the inputs and outputs of the built-in PCA function and reverse engineer the function to understand how the outputs are derived from the inputs, thus enhancing my knowledge of the logic behind PCA.

Ultimately, the regression model achieved an R squared value of 0.60, which my research professor deemed good enough for practical use. This was a marked improvement compared to a model created by a previous research team, which achieved an R squared value of 0.45.

I believe that this project has helped me develop a new mindset. Upon joining the research team, I felt under qualified and lost with no idea how or where to begin. However, I grew to love the sense of uncertainty that came with trying to solve a problem with no established solution and the feeling of accomplishment after grasping previously foreign concepts. Equally important to the idea of embracing uncertainty is the concept of adopting a growth mindset. In order to improve upon my problem-solving capabilities, I continuously looking for opportunities to challenge myself and learn.

### Apex consulting

Apex Consulting is an on campus student run organization at the University of Michigan dedicated to providing pro bono consulting services to local Michigan clientele. During my time at Apex Consulting, I have acted as a business analyst, a project manager, and the head of recruitment. I have been involved in three consulting projects, each with differing industries and scale. As a business analyst, I conducted extensive and thorough research for every topic I was assigned in order to provide my client with recommendations and supporting evidence for my claims. I wrote research reports and compiled presentation slide decks in order to present my findings. As a project manager, I was responsible for determining the scope of my project, delegating research responsibilities to my analysts, and creating a timeline and ensuring that my team stayed on track. I was also in charge of maintaining communications between my team and our client. As the head of recruitment, I was responsible for the scheduling, planning, and execution of all recruiting events, as well as the creation and distribution of marketing material. I pioneered an applicant grading system that proved successful in making our recruiting process more objective and ensuring that we accepted the best candidates possible.

My involvement with Apex Consulting has helped me develop a breadth of both soft and hard skills. I learnt how to approach and resolve complex problems and gained an ability to operate under uncertainty as clients may sometimes be unwilling to disclose too much information. I also developed strong communicative and collaborative skills by working in various teams with different team dynamics and interacting with different types of clients.

### Techture Limited

During the summer of 2019, I worked in an event management role in Hong Kong, and was responsible for organizing and executing a 2-month long Smart City Showcase with the intent of raising awareness of the concept and importance of smart cities to the general public. Unfortunately, it was a summer of unrest in Hong Kong, with frequent protests happening right by our event venue. Naturally, this hugely impacted the success of our event - sponsors backed out and not many guests came. Determined to make the best of an undesirable situation, my team and I worked overtime to implement drastic changes. Over the next few weeks, we worked to increase our social media presence, negotiate new terms with sponsors, and invite other event organizers to share our venue in order to encourage guests outside of our target demographic to visit. Additionally, my boss entrusted me with handling all event site logistics so she could focus on other matters. I was incredibly flattered by the amount of trust my boss placed in me and I worked hard to repay her faith by engaging myself in all aspects of on-site logistics and planning, setting high standards, and holding myself accountable to these standards. It is very satisfying to say that I was able to persevere through the many difficulties I faced with little to no guidance. We ultimately achieved an average daily attendance of 150+ guests and this remains as one of my proudest accomplishment to date.
