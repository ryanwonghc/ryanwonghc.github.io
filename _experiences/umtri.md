During my freshman and sophomore years of college, I was a data analyst at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. My team and I aimed to evaluate the influence of variations in body geometry on body impact responses. My role was to capture and model the variability in the head region. I did so by processing patient anthropometric measurements and CT scans to create a dataset of medical data. Using this dataset, I created and refined a regression model that predicts an individual’s head shape and size given their medical data. These predictions were then used to create individualized finite element models of the subject’s body that were subjected to simulated impact testing to evaluate the subject’s injury risk in different vehicular accidents. Ultimately, this injury assessment data will be used to create vehicle safety designs to better protect vulnerable populations.

With no prior statistics experience, the most challenging technical aspect of the project was grasping the concept and purpose of principal component analysis (PCA) then putting the theory into practice. I was able to overcome this by taking full advantage of all the resources at my disposal. From reading articles to watching videos to asking professors and peers for help, I sought to accumulate as much information about PCA as I could. Equally important was my willingness to learn by doing. I began creating my regression model on MATLAB before I had fully grasped the concept of PCA, and the process of debugging my program greatly aided my understanding of PCA. Using the debugger, I was able to visualize the inputs and outputs of the built-in PCA function and reverse engineer the function to understand how the outputs are derived from the inputs, thus enhancing my knowledge of the logic behind PCA.

Ultimately, the regression model achieved an R squared value of 0.60, which my research professor deemed good enough for practical use. This was a marked improvement compared to a model created by a previous research team, which achieved an R squared value of 0.45.

I believe that this project has helped me develop a new mindset. Upon joining the research team, I felt under qualified and lost with no idea how or where to begin. However, I grew to love the sense of uncertainty that came with trying to solve a problem with no established solution and the feeling of accomplishment after grasping previously foreign concepts. Equally important to the idea of embracing uncertainty is the concept of adopting a growth mindset. In order to improve upon my problem-solving capabilities, I continuously looking for opportunities to challenge myself and learn.
