Apex Consulting is an on campus student run organization at the University of Michigan dedicated to providing pro bono consulting services to local Michigan clientele. During my time at Apex Consulting, I have acted as a business analyst, a project manager, and the head of recruitment. I have been involved in three consulting projects, each with differing industries and scale. As a business analyst, I conducted extensive and thorough research for every topic I was assigned in order to provide my client with recommendations and supporting evidence for my claims. I wrote research reports and compiled presentation slide decks in order to present my findings. As a project manager, I was responsible for determining the scope of my project, delegating research responsibilities to my analysts, and creating a timeline and ensuring that my team stayed on track. I was also in charge of maintaining communications between my team and our client. As the head of recruitment, I was responsible for the scheduling, planning, and execution of all recruiting events, as well as the creation and distribution of marketing material. I pioneered an applicant grading system that proved successful in making our recruiting process more objective and ensuring that we accepted the best candidates possible.

My involvement with Apex Consulting has helped me develop a breadth of both soft and hard skills. I learnt how to approach and resolve complex problems and gained an ability to operate under uncertainty as clients may sometimes be unwilling to disclose too much information. I also developed strong communicative and collaborative skills by working in various teams with different team dynamics and interacting with different types of clients.
